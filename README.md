# Udacity Front-end Arcade Game Project

This project, a classic arcade game clone, was developed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. With provided visual assets and a game loop engine, the project guidelines called for the creation and addition of the various in-game entities, such as the player, enemies, and collectibles, using object-oriented JavaScript. In addition, the game's rules and mechanics (such as enemy movement, collision detection, score-keeping, etc.) were also added.
